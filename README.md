### Simple word2vec

This document was to train and test word2vec model
the code to train the model is almost exactly this: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec , but changed slightly, for the sake of learning

The differences are:
1) Changed the input dataset
2) Changed the negative sample number, window size, batchsize, ...
3) changed the design of the model
4) wrote a similarity function at the end
5) imported genism and tested the results with genism


## Result:
I am pretty sure the model sucks unless we feed a very reach data.
